Day 36 : The Assumption-Free Rule - Answer What’s Asked, Not What You Think

Most interview failures happen because people assume the question
and give the wrong answer.

Smart professionals do this instead:
👉 Pause 2 seconds
👉 Repeat the key part of the question in your mind
👉 Then answer exactly that

It makes your reply clean, relevant, and impressive.

Task for Today:
Question: “Tell me a challenge you handled.”
Repeat: “Challenge I handled.”
Then answer.
You’ll notice instant clarity.

 Relevance beats long answers - every single time.
