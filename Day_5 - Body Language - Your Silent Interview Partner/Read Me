Day 5: Body Language – Your Silent Interview Partner

Before you say a word, your body already spoke.

Your posture, handshake, and smile tell more than your resume ever could.
Interviewers remember energy, not just answers.

 Sitting stiff = nervous.
 Leaning too much = casual.
 Balanced, open posture = confident &amp; calm.

 Task for Today:
⦁	 Stand in front of a mirror for 2 minutes.
⦁	 Practice , maintaining eye contact and a natural smile.
⦁	 Notice the difference when your body supports your words.
⦁	 Remember: Confidence isn’t loud — it’s visible.
