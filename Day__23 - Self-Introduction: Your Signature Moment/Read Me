Day 23 - Self-Introduction: Your Signature Moment

A self-introduction is more than name and course — it’s your chance to leave a first impression that lasts.
Confidence here sets the tone for everything that follows.

The best intros sound natural, not memorized.

Task:
Prepare a 45-second version using this pattern:
* Name
* Background (Education & Experience)
* Core Skill
* Career Goal

Practice until it feels like you’re talking, not reciting.
