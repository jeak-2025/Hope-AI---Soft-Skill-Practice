Day 3: Resume Building – Your First Impression on Paper

Your resume isn’t your life story - it’s your highlight.

Recruiters don’t “read” resumes; they scan them - for just 6 seconds. 

So ask yourself: what will your resume say in those 6 seconds?
Does it show outcomes or only duties?

Try this today:
 ✅ Replace “Worked on project” with “Built ML model improving accuracy by 20%.”
 ✅ Keep it — simple, clean, and crisp.
