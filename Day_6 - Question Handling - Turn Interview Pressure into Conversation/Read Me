Day 6: Question Handling – Turn Interview Pressure into Conversation

You know that moment when the interviewer asks,

 “Do you have any questions for us?” — and we freeze? 
 That’s your chance to stand out, not the time to escape.

Smart candidates don’t just answer — they ask the right questions.
 It shows curiosity, confidence, and clarity.

 Task for Today:
  Write down 2 questions you could ask at the end of an interview, like:

 • “What does a successful first 90 days look like in this role?”
 • “How does the team usually collaborate on new projects?”

Practice asking them naturally — it leaves a strong final impression.
Great interviews end with great curiosity.
