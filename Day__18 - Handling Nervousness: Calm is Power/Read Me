Day 17 – Handling Nervousness: Calm Is Power

Everyone feels nervous - even the most confident speakers. The difference is, professionals don’t fight nervousness; they manage it.

That racing heartbeat isn’t fear - it’s energy waiting to be directed.

When you control your breathing, you control your focus.

A calm presence always leaves a stronger impression than perfect words.

Task:
Before your next presentation or answer, take a deep breath, smile, and pause for 2 seconds before you start.

That small act will anchor your confidence.
