Day 11: Storytelling – The Art That Makes Your Ideas Stick

When you explain your project like a list, people forget. But when you share it as a story, they feel it.
 
Storytelling transforms “I built a model” into “I solved a problem that once frustrated users.”

Every story has 3 parts:
1️⃣ The problem you faced,
2️⃣ The action you took,
3️⃣ The result you achieved.

This formula isn’t just for presentations - it’s for interviews, pitches, and even team discussions.

Task:
Choose one of your past projects. 
Frame it in the Problem → Action → Result format and record yourself explaining it in under two minutes. 
Watch how much more confident and engaging you sound.
