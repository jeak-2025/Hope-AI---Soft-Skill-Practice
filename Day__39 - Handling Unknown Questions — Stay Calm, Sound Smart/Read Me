Day 39: Handling Unknown Questions — Stay Calm, Sound Smart

Professionals don’t know every answer.
But they know how to respond with maturity.

When you’re unsure, don’t panic.

Use the golden sentence:

I may not have the exact answer at the moment, but I’m very eager to learn it and I can pick it up quickly

This shows responsibility, clarity, and professionalism
- not weakness.

Task for Today:
The next time someone asks you something you’re not sure of,
use this line confidently.

This one sentence tells people:
"I don’t guess. I verify."

If you’re adopting this today, comment “Checking & Confident”.
