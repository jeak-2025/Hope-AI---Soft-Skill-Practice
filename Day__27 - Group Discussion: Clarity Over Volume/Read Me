Day 27 – Group Discussion: Clarity Over Volume

GD isn’t about who talks most; it’s about who adds structure, balance, and progress. Especially for freshers. 

Start with a frame, add one strong point, invite another voice.

Task:
Practice this 3-step GD script:

- Frame the topic in one line
- Add one data-backed or logical point
- Invite (“Happy to hear others’ views on this topic”)
