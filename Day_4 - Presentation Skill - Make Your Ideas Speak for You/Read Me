Todays Soft Skill Tip:

*Day 4: Presentation Skill – Make Your Ideas Speak for You

* Have you noticed? 

*Some people explain the same project, but the whole room listens only to them.* 
*It’s not the slides — it’s the story.* 
*A great presentation isn’t about animation or fonts;* 
*it’s about how clearly you connect the problem → solution → result.

* Task for Today: 
⦁ Pick one project you’ve done. 
⦁ Explain it in 90 seconds using this flow: 
⦁ Problem → What I did → Result → One line learning. 
⦁ Record yourself once — you’ll instantly see where you can sound sharper. 
⦁ Presentation skill = storytelling + structure + spark. Practice this, and every demo day will feel like your spotlight moment.
