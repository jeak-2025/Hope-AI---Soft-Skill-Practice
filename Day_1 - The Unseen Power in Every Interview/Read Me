Day 1: Soft Skill – The Unseen Power in Every Interview

Have you ever wondered why some people walk into a room and instantly create an impression  even before they speak? 
 
It’s not luck. It’s their soft skills silently speaking for them.

 You can learn Python, SQL, or AI - but if you can’t explain your idea clearly, how will others see your potential?
 Soft skills are the bridge between what you know and how others trust you.

 Try this today:
 ✅ Maintain eye contact for 3 seconds longer.
 ✅ Listen fully before replying.
 ✅ Replace “I don’t know” with “That’s interesting, let me think about it.”

Soft skill isn’t about talking more - it’s about connecting better.✨
