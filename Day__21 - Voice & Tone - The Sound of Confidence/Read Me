Day 21 – Voice & Tone: The Sound of Confidence

Your voice carries emotion, energy, and authority.

How you say something often matters more than what you say.
Fast speech shows anxiety; a slow, balanced tone shows calm control.

A confident tone earns attention before your words do.

Task:
Record yourself answering: “Why should we hire you?”
Listen to your tone — are you clear, calm, and confident?
Re-record once until it feels natural.
