Day 41  – Smile Once in the Morning

The first thing you do in the morning sets the tone for your entire day.

A small smile sends a simple message to your mind:

“Today will be good. I can handle things calmly.”

This one-second habit makes your morning lighter, softer, and more positive.
It is the easiest way to begin your day with confidence.

Task :
Tomorrow morning, before touching your phone, just smile once. That’s it.
