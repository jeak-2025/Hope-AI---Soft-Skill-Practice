Day 22 – Resume Communication: Let Numbers Tell Your Story

Your resume is not just a document — it’s your first conversation with an employer.

Recruiters scan in seconds, so every line must speak outcomes.

Action + Impact = Impression.

Task:
Pick two lines from your resume and rewrite them like this:

“Developed X that improved Y by Z%.”
For example: “Built a data model that increased accuracy by 15%.”

Now your work sounds measurable and memorable.
