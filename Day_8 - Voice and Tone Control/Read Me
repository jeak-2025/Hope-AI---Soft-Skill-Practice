*Day 8: Voice &amp; Tone Control – Sound Like the Professional You Want to Be
Ever noticed?*

 Two people say the same answer… but one sounds nervous, while the other sounds confident.
 It’s not what they said — it’s how they said it. 

Your voice is your first handshake in every interview.
 Fast = anxious.
 Monotone = bored.
 Calm + clear + paced = confident &amp; ready.

 Task for Today:

 Pick one common interview question — “Why do you want this role?”
 Record your answer twice:
 1️⃣ Fast and flat.
 2️⃣ Slow, clear, and energetic.

 Listen to both. You’ll hear your growth.

 A confident tone tells the interviewer, “You can trust me.”
