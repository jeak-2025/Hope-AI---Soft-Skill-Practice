*Day 19 – Team Communication: Collaboration Over Competition*

A great team doesn’t mean zero differences — it means open communication that turns differences into strength.

Every idea shared makes the team smarter. Silence kills innovation.

*When you speak to lift the team, you naturally become a leader.*

Task:
In your next group or project chat, share one update, idea, or helpful resource — something that adds value to others.
Notice how collaboration feels more natural.
