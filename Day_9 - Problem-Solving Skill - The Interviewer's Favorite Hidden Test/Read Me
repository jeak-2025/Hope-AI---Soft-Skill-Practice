Day 9: Problem-Solving Skill – The Interviewer’s Favorite Hidden Test

Technical rounds test logic.
 HR rounds test attitude.

 But every round secretly checks one thing — how you think when stuck.

You don’t need all the right answers.
 You need the right approach.

When faced with a tough question, don’t panic —
 💭 Think aloud. Show your steps.

 Interviewers love clarity more than perfection.

 Task for Today:
  Take any tricky interview question from your field.

 Write your thought process in 3 lines:
 Step 1 – What’s the problem?
 Step 2 – How would I approach it?
 Step 3 – What’s my backup plan?

 Solving out loud shows confidence, logic, and calm under pressure.
