Day 33 – Interview Storytelling: Turn Experiences into Impact

Facts tell, but stories sell your personality and potential.

Instead of listing tasks, turn each achievement into a short narrative — challenge, action, and result.
This turns routine experience into memorable impact.

Interviewers remember stories, not sentences.

Task:
Pick one project or internship and build a 45-second story:

What was the challenge?

What action did you take?

What outcome followed?

Practice it once with a friend or mirror.
