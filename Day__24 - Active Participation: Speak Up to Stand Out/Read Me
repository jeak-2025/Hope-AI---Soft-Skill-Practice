Day 24 – Active Participation: Speak Up to Stand Out

Opportunities rarely knock twice - they wait for those who speak up first.

Every time you share an idea, ask a question, or volunteer, you build visibility and credibility.

Your voice is your growth tool - use it.

Task:

In your next class, session, or meeting, share one thought, question, or suggestion.
Don’t wait to be perfect - participation is progress.
