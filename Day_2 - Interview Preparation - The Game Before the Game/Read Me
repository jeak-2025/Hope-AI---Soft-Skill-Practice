Day 2: Interview Preparation – The Game Before the Game

Ever felt this? You know the answers… but your mind goes blank during interviews? 

 That’s not fear — that’s lack of rehearsal.

 Think of an interview like a stage show — even pros rehearse to make confidence look natural.
 Interviews are not about answers; they’re about how you think.

Try this today:

⦁	 Record your “Tell me about yourself.”
⦁	 Watch it — were you confident? Natural? Smiling?
⦁	 You’re not preparing for a company - you’re preparing for your moment.
